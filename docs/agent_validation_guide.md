# Agent Validation Framework

## Overview
All navigation agents must now include validation fields in their responses to ensure proper boundary enforcement and task completion verification.

## Required Response Fields

### previous_step_status
- **Values**: success, failed, incomplete, pending
- **Purpose**: Indicates whether the previous step completed successfully
- **Validation**: Agents cannot proceed if previous step failed

### task_completion_validation  
- **Values**: completed, partial, failed, not_started
- **Purpose**: Validates that the current task was actually completed
- **Validation**: Only "completed" allows task termination

### verification_result
- **Purpose**: Specific evidence that the task was completed successfully
- **Validation**: Must contain concrete verification details

## Termination Rules
- Tasks can only terminate if all validation fields indicate success
- Failed validations block termination and require retry or escalation
- The orchestration layer enforces these rules automatically

## Example Valid Response

```
previous_step: User login form filled
previous_step_status: success
task_completion_validation: completed
verification_result: Login button clicked successfully, redirected to dashboard page with user profile visible
current_output: Login process completed successfully
##FLAG::SAVE_IN_MEM##
##TERMINATE TASK##
```

## Example Invalid Response (Blocked)

```
previous_step: User login attempted
previous_step_status: failed
task_completion_validation: completed
verification_result: Login failed but marked as completed
current_output: Login process completed
##TERMINATE TASK##
```

This response would be blocked because:
1. Previous step failed but current task marked as completed (inconsistent)
2. The validation framework prevents this contradiction

## Implementation Notes

- All navigation agents have been updated with validation requirements
- The orchestration layer automatically validates responses before allowing termination
- Validation errors provide specific guidance on what needs to be corrected
- The framework maintains backward compatibility while adding robust validation controls
