## What is TestZeus Hercules?

TestZeus Hercules is an AI-powered test automation framework that transforms natural language test descriptions into executable test automation. Using advanced multi-agent architecture, Hercules can understand, plan, and execute complex test scenarios across web applications, APIs, databases, and security testing.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Test Execution
Hercules uses large language models to understand test requirements and automatically generate execution plans. The system can adapt to different UI states and handle complex scenarios without manual intervention.

### ðŸŽ¯ Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Planner Agent**: Analyzes test cases and creates detailed execution plans
- **Browser Agent**: Handles web UI interactions and validations
- **API Agent**: Manages REST API testing and validations
- **Security Agent**: Performs security testing and vulnerability assessments
- **SQL Agent**: Executes database operations and validations
- **TimeKeeper Agent**: Manages timing and wait operations

### ðŸ”§ Flexible Configuration
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, Gemini)
- Configurable browser settings and remote testing platforms
- Environment-based configuration management
- Custom tool integration capabilities

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Reporting
- Detailed test execution reports
- Screenshot capture for visual validation
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to create a test with Hercules:

```gherkin
Feature: User Login Validation

  Scenario: Successful user login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message
```

That's it! Hercules will automatically:
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Find and fill the credential fields
3. Click the login button
4. Verify the redirect and welcome message
5. Generate a detailed test report
