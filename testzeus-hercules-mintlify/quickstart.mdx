## Installation

Get started by installing Hercules using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install testzeus-hercules
```

```bash Docker
docker pull testzeus/hercules:latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Set Up Your LLM Provider

Hercules requires an LLM provider to function. Set up your API key for your preferred provider:

<CodeGroup>

```bash OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

```bash Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

```bash Groq
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Hercules supports multiple LLM providers. See our [LLM Setup Guide](/configuration/llm-setup) for complete configuration options.
</Note>

## Create Your First Test

Create a new file called `my-first-test.feature`:

```gherkin my-first-test.feature
Feature: Google Search Test

  Scenario: Search for TestZeus Hercules
    Given I have a web browser open
    When I navigate to "https://www.google.com"
    And I search for "TestZeus Hercules"
    Then I should see search results
    And the results should contain "testzeus"
```

## Run Your Test

Execute your test using the Hercules CLI:

```bash
hercules my-first-test.feature
```

That's it! Hercules will:
1. üöÄ Launch a browser
2. üîç Navigate to Google
3. üìù Perform the search
4. ‚úÖ Validate the results
5. üìä Generate a detailed report

## View Results

After execution, you'll find:
- **Test report**: `results/test_results.html`
- **Screenshots**: `results/screenshots/`
- **Logs**: `results/logs/`

<Tip>
  Use the `--headless false` flag to watch Hercules execute your tests in a visible browser window.
